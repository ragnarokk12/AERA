                <h2><i>Lyceum of the Philippines University</i></h2>
                <center>
                    <p>The founder, Dr. Jose P. Laurel, left behind a long and rich tradition of academic excellence that the Lyceum of the Philippines University takes great pride in. Dr. Laurel was a successful lawyer, legislator, constitutionalist, jurist, writer, scholar, statesman, philosopher, and above all an educator. 
                        He was the only Filipino president to hold positions in all three branches of government. <br>Dr. Laurel's greatest enduring passion was education. 
                        His credentials as an educator were unquestionable, having graduated from esteemed institutions like Yale University, Escuela de Derecho, University of Santo Tomas, and University of the Philippines College of Law. 
                        Despite his many responsibilities, he managed to teach in a number of Manila's educational establishments and wrote a great deal about education. 
                        <br>As the country's leader during its darkest hour during World War II, he instituted educational policies that prioritized and sustained national character and morale. 
                        He was a Yale student when he got the idea to start a school in the early 1920s. Thirty years later, he realized this dream with the help of a few close friends. 
                       <br> On July 7, 1952, the now-named Lyceum of the Philippines University officially opened to the public with the goal of becoming a hub of academic excellence in the Philippines and the Far East.
                        Dr. Laurel named the school Lyceum of the Philippines in honor of Lykeios, the location in classical Athens where the renowned philosopher Aristotle fostered the minds of his students. 
                        Dr. Laurel had a great regard for knowledge and classical thought. <br>Dr. Laurel's conviction in the importance of education and character development for God and country is reflected in the school's motto, "Veritas et Fortitudo," or "Pro Deo et Patria."
                        Sadly, Dr. Laurel passed away suddenly in 1959. His third son, Sotero, who was practicing law at the time, inherited the duty of overseeing the school. 
                        He was the obvious choice because Senator Sotero had served as his father's first executive secretary and had assisted his father in organizing LPU years earlier. 
                        <br>It was Sotero, the chosen son, who took care of the school for the next forty-three years and saw it expand from Manila into the provinces. The Lyceum of the Philippines University-Batangas was established by him in 1966, and the Lyceum of the Philippines-Laguna in 2000. 
                        Dr. Peter P. Laurel, the fourth son of Senator Laurel, is currently in charge of both campuses. <br>With the establishment of a fifth campus in Cavite in 2008, LPU now has five campuses and a total enrollment of about 37,000 students, of which about 15,000 are enrolled in various hospitality courses. 
                        The oldest son of Senator Laurel, Atty. In charge of the campuses in Manila, Makati, and Cavite is Roberto P. Laurel.
                        LPU Davao will begin operations in 2019 under the direction of Dr. Peter P. Laurel.
